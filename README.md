# clean-papers
### Clean your paper before sharing the source code

See the walkthrough in "main.py"

First, add the source code as a file, and rename it as "input.txt".<br>
Then run "main.py".<br>
The output file will be created as "output.txt"<br>
(warning: if you already have a "output.txt" file in the folder, it will be overwritten.)
